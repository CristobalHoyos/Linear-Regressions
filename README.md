# Linear-Regressions

During this excercise I have learned about what is a liner regression, how to workout a linear regression with code and how it can be useful for analysis.

Linear regressions are also referred to as correlation coefficients. They show the strength of the correlation between the two quantitative variables being graphed, there is a table of values which shows the ranges of linear regressions and their meanings (positive moderate, negative weak, etc.) 
Also linear regression lines (line of best fit) are useful to visually support and explain trends seen on complex and confusing scatter graphs and summarize them into a single line easy to understand.
The code I did I used one of the datasets im using for my final project and ill definitely use it oin many other scatter plots since it quantifies the strength of the relationship between two varaibles therefore explicitly showing how related they are or not.

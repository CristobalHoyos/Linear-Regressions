# Linear-Regressions

During this exercise I have learned about what is a linear regression, how to work out a linear regression with code and how it can be useful for analysis.Linear regressions are also referred to as correlation coefficients. They show the strength of the correlation between the two quantitative variables being graphed, there is a table of values which shows the ranges of linear regressions and their meanings (positive moderate, negative weak, etc.) Also linear regression lines (line of best fit) are useful to visually support and explain trends seen on complex and confusing scatter graphs and summarize them into a single line easy to understand. The code I did I used one of the datasets I'm using for my final project and i'll definitely use it in many other scatter plots since it quantifies the strength of the relationship between two variables, therefore explicitly showing how related they are or not.
